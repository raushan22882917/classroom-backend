Let's dive into one of the most pivotal experiments in the history of physics – Oersted's experiment. It beautifully demonstrated the fundamental connection between electricity and magnetism.\n\n---\n\n### Oersted's Experiment: Unveiling the Link Between Electricity and Magnetism\n\nBefore 1820, electricity and magnetism were largely considered two separate branches of physics. It was Hans Christian Ørsted, a Danish physicist, who, through a simple yet profound experiment, demonstrated a direct and undeniable connection between them.\n\n#### The Experimental Setup:\n\n1.  **Materials:** Ørsted used a straight conducting wire, a battery (or power source) to provide current, a switch to control the current flow, and a magnetic compass needle.\n2.  **Arrangement:** He placed the straight conducting wire *parallel* to and *just above* a magnetic compass needle. Initially, with no current flowing, the compass needle pointed in its usual North-South direction, aligned with the Earth's magnetic field.\n\n#### The Procedure and Observations:\n\nØrsted performed the following steps and made crucial observations:\n\n1.  **Current ON:** When an electric current was allowed to flow through the wire (by closing the switch), the magnetic compass needle, which was initially pointing North-South, **deflected** from its usual position. This deflection indicated that the compass needle was experiencing a magnetic force, implying the presence of a magnetic field.\n    *   *Example:* If the current flowed from South to North in the wire placed above the compass, the North pole of the compass needle deflected towards the West.\n\n2.  **Current OFF:** When the current was switched off, the compass needle immediately **returned to its original North-South orientation**. This showed that the magnetic effect was directly linked to the flow of current.\n\n3.  **Reversing Current Direction:** When the direction of the current in the wire was reversed (e.g., from North to South), the compass needle **deflected in the opposite direction** (e.g., towards the East,","contexts":[],"confidence":0.7,"sources":[],"metadata":{"mode":"gemini_grounding","subject":"physics"}}
