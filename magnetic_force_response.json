{"query":"A straight wire of mass 200 g and length 1.5 m carries a current of 2 A. It is suspended in mid-air by a uniform horizontal magnetic field B (Fig. 4.3). What is the magnitude of the magnetic field?","generated_text":"Hello there! This is a classic problem that combines the concepts of forces in a magnetic field and equilibrium. Let's break it down step-by-step to find the magnitude of the magnetic field.\n\n### Understanding the Physics\n\nFor the wire to be \"suspended in mid-air,\" it means that the net force acting on it is zero. In this scenario, two main forces are acting on the wire:\n\n1.  **Gravitational Force ($F_g$):** This force acts downwards due to the wire's mass.\n2.  **Magnetic Force ($F_m$):** This force acts upwards, counteracting gravity, because the wire carries a current in a magnetic field.\n\nTherefore, for the wire to be suspended, the upward magnetic force must be equal in magnitude to the downward gravitational force.\n\n$F_m = F_g$\n\n### Given Information\n\nLet's list the values provided in the problem:\n\n*   Mass of the wire, $m = 200 \\text{ g} = 0.2 \\text{ kg}$ (Remember to convert grams to kilograms for SI units).\n*   Length of the wire, $L = 1.5 \\text{ m}$\n*   Current in the wire, $I","contexts":[],"confidence":0.7,"sources":[],"metadata":{"mode":"gemini_grounding","subject":"physics"}}
